         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Quest. <hi>To whom must wee direct our Prayers?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                     <q>The Papists reason against this: and they bring rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to proue it lawfull to pray to the good Angels, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                        </label> and to the Saints departed: as first this;</q>
                     <p>Honour is to bee giuen to the good Angels and Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and according to their excellency which is heauenly:
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:493:3"/> therefore we may call on them, and pray to them.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>How is this to be answered?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus; honour is due to the good Angels and Saints departed, yet such as hath warrant in Gods Word (that is) that we beleeue they are in eternall happinesse with Christ; we publish and set foorth their faith, pietie, constancie and other vertues in the Church, and that we propound them to our selues and others for imitation, and not that wee call on them or pray to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>2</label> It is lawfull to call vpon men liuing, and while we liue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we may request one anothers prayers, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is lawfull to pray to the Saints departed.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>How is this to be answered?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus; It is no good consequent, wee may request the liuing to pray for vs, therefore the dead: Because for the first we haue both precept and promise, but for the other, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precept nor promise.</p>
                     <p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>3</label> If it be not lawfull to pray to the Saints departed, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because they cannot pray for vs, or because they will not, or because they know not what we pray for; but (say they) the Saints in heauen can now much more pray for vs then they could while they were liuing in the earth, and they are now more willing to pray for vs, because their loue is greater then when they were on earth, it being now perfect; and as the Angels know the conuersion of a sinner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.10.<note place="margin">Luk. 15.10.</note> so the Saints departed know our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Therefore it is lawfull to pray to them.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>How is this to be answered?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus; It is true, the Saints departed can pray for vs, and their loue being now perfect, they are willing, and doe wish well to the whole militant Church, and to all the members of it equally and indifferently, but that they pray for particular persons cannot be proued.</p>
                     <p>Againe, there is not the same reason why the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted should know things said or done by vs on earth as the Angels doe; for the Angels are appointed ministering Spirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14.<note place="margin">Heb. 1.14.</note> and know many particulars that come to vs, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:493:3"/> many of our priuate necessities, but the Saints departed doe not, being alwayes in heauen absent from vs, yet the worship, and consequently the Inuocation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells is forbidden, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.18. Much more of the Saints departed, they neither hearing nor knowing what wee pray for.</p>

                     <p>Quest. <hi>How is this to bee answered?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus; it appeares not in any place of the Scripture, that God reueiles to the Saints departed what is prayed for.</p>

                        <hi>Iob</hi> 5.1. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> saith, <hi>Call now, if any will answere thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turne thee.</hi> Therefore it is lawfull to call vpon, and to pray to the good Angels and Saints departed.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, the phrase <hi>(turne thee)</hi> doth not signifie Inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or calling on, but as if <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had sayd, Giue mee (oh <hi>Iob</hi>) if thou canst, any of the Saints of God, who if he were pressed with any calamitie, that did not suffer the same for his sinnes: That is the drift of the Holy Ghost in that place.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> To euery person: wee may direct our prayers to God the Father, to God the Sonne, and to God the Holy Ghost, so as wee doe it with due obseruation of some neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary cautions to God the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9.

                     <p>Quest. <hi>What are the cautions that are duly and necessarily to be obserued in directing our prayers to the persons in the Trinitie?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This; when wee direct our prayers to one person in Trinitie, wee must in minde and heart include the other: because though the persons in Trinitie bee distinct, yet in all the duties of Gods worship performed by vs, the name of any Person, Father, Sonne, or Holy Ghost, is to bee taken essentially, not personally: and wee are to conceiue the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther subsisting in the same Godhead or diuine nature with the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>Againe, in all outward actions the persons in Trinity work together, and are only distinguished in the manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: therefore we must not seuer them in wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This; when we pray to Christ, we must not seuer his two natures, his Godhead from his manhood; but we must call on him as he is God and man: for though his manhood is not to be worshipped with religious worship, for it selfe, or by it selfe, because by it selfe it is a creature; but as it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally vnited to the Godhead, it is part of that person which is true God, and therefore to be worshipped with one and the same worship that the Godhead is to be worshipped. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>When hee bringeth his only begotten Son into the world, he saith, Let all the Angels of God worship him.</hi> The Angels of God must worship the first begotten Son of God brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world (that is) God and man.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> In the name and mediation of Christ to come, as they beleeued in him to come: for as his Sacrifice was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall before his Incarnation and comming in the flesh, hee being <hi>the Lambe slaine from the beginning of the world, Reuel.</hi> 13.8. so was his Intercession: therefore they had their Priest, who did onely enter into the Sanctuary, and carry the names of the children of Israel before the Lord, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple stood without, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.29. which did signifie and poynt out Christ.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, in that they thinke God is nearer vnto vs in one place then in an other, and therefore goe on pilgrimage from place to place: for heauen is equally distant from all places,<note place="margin">Ioh 4.23.</note> and distinction of place in regard of Gods presence and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is taken away.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This; the foolish opinion of ignorant persons, who thinke that God sits in heauen like an old man with a Crown on his head, and a Scepter in his hand;<note place="margin">Deut. 4.15.16. 1 Tim. 6.16.</note> which is a carnall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of Gods maiestie, which is heauenly and most glorious: and it is forbidden in the word of God.</p>

                     <p>Quest. <hi>May one that is truly called and conuerted, and a child of God, pray for his owne death, and the separation of his soule from his body, or no?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This; they are to desire, and so to pray not onely out of their loue to the partie in some priuate and particular respect; but also out of a desire, that the partie being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the body, may doe more good, either in the Church or Common weale, according to his place and calling, and measure of gifts and grace giuen to him: and thus much the Apostle doth imply, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.24, 25, 26.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> Quest. <hi>Gods will being manifested by particular euents, good or euill, how is God free from willing euill, and from being the authour of euill?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Euill is two fold, euill of punishment,<note place="margin">Isai. 45.7. Amos 3.6.</note> or euill of sinne: the first of these God willeth, and is the authour of, for punishment being a worke of Iustice against sinne is good, and therefore willed and wrought by God.

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus: if God permit sinne, hee doth it either wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly or against his will: if willingly, then it is not by bare permission, by a powerfull working permission, if against his will, then is he not omnipotent to let &amp; hinder that thing he willeth not, and that is blasphemie to thinke.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Concerning that, we are to learne two distinctions.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What is the first of those?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This: there be two things in sinne, the subiect or matter of sin, which is either a motion, a qualitie, or an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or the forme of sinne, that which maketh the motion, qualitie or action, to be a sinne, and that is transgression of the law of God properly called by some, deformitie of the motion, qualitie or action.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What is the second distinction we are to learne?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This; there is difference betweene sin it selfe sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie considered in it selfe &amp; by it selfe, and the euent of sin, or the comming to passe of sin, for sinne it selfe is euill, but the comming to passe of sinne is good, in respect of the end to which it is by God disposed (namely) his glory in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of his Iustice and Mercy.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>These two distinctions learned, how then are we to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of Gods willing of the euill of sinne?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus: God willeth the motion, qualitie or action, which is the subiect or matter of sin,<note place="margin">Act. 17.28.</note> for he is the first mouer or efficient in euery motion and action, as it is a motion or action: but he willeth not the deformitie, prauitie or euill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the motion or action. For example, in the act of Theft and taking away of another mans goods, the action of mouing the body, of stirring the seuerall ioynts, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the hand, whereby the goods are taken hold of, are willed and wrought by God.</p>
                     <p>But the applying of those actions to this end, that our Neighbour may thereby be depriued of his goods, and we by them inriched: this is the deformitie of those actions, &amp; not willed nor effected by God.</p>
                     <p>Againe, God willeth not sin simply considered in it selfe as it is sin, and against his Commandement, but only willeth the euent, or comming to passe of sinne.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>How doth God will the euent, or comming to passe of sinne?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus; not by effecting it, but by with holding his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:493:26"/> grace from his creature, and not hindering it when he might, if hee would, and so only by consequent God willeth the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of sinne, be not hindering it, hee willingly permits it to be done for a good end, (namely) the glory of his name in the execution of his Iustice, or the manifestation of his mercie. God often punisheth one sinne with another, now all sinne is eu ll if wee respect it selfe, but as it is a punishment of some former euill, in that respect it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, but iust and a good thing, and so the euent or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of it to passe is willed by God. Thus we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that God willed the hardening of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart. <hi>Exodus</hi> 9.12. the deceiuing of <hi>Ahab</hi> with a Lie.<note place="margin">2 Thess. 2.11.</note> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.22. And thus hee willeth the delusion of such as are deceiued by the deceiuable working of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Emissaries, the shaueling Locusts, <hi>Jesuites</hi> and Priests.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>

But an immoderate desire of the outward good things of this life is neuer satisfied; but the more a man or woman hath of those things, the more they desire: and the enioying of one thing desired, is but the beginning of desire of another: as an vnnaturall thirst, which a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie or an Ague causeth, the more a man drinks, the more hee desires. <hi>Prou.</hi> 30.8.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This: that God would by his good spirit apply to vs the pardon of our sins daily, and by the same Spirit would more and more witnesse to vs, and assure vs that our sinnes are pardoned, and strengthen our faith to full assurance of it, we being already iustified in his sight. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5.16. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.14. By faith we receiue the spirit, (that is) more fully and manifestly dwelling in vs, to our sanctification and assurance, touching our redemption, and the pardon of our sinnes. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.13. The spirit is compared to a seale, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caue he confirmes vs in our faith, and assurance of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our sinnes.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What reason is there for it, that we being already iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and hauing our sinnes forgiuen, are still to seeke and craue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse at the hands of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Because it is needfull that God should as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his grace and fauour to vs, touching the pardon of our sinnes, as giue it to vs at the first: and that God should actually pardon our sinnes daily committed: hence <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> prayed for actuall forgiuenesse of sinnes: <hi>Psalme</hi> 51.1. though <hi>Nathan</hi> had told him that his sinne was forgiuen. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> No, he doth not; remission of sinnes and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the blood of Christ, are equiualent, of equall reach and signification. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.14. And redemption by the blood of Christ, is freedome from the curse of the Law, which is both of all plagues heere in this world, and all paines and torments after this life is ended.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>How may it farther appeare, that God pardoning the fault &amp; eternall punishment of sin, be retaines a temporary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be inflicted on them that haue sinned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> By two reasons especially.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What is the first of those?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This: If God inflict any punishment on him whose sinnes are taken away by the blood of Christ, as <hi>John.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lambe of God which taketh away the sinnes of the World:</hi> then is he vniust, it is all one as to require payment and satisfaction of a debt forgiuen, which were most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust: but there is no iniustice with God, and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines not a temporarie punishment to be inflicted on them that haue sinned.</p>
                     <p>Question. <hi>What is the second reason by which it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that God pardoning the fault and eternall punishment of sin, he retaines not a temporarie punishment to be inflicted on them that haue sinned?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This: If it bee true that when God doth not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don sinne, hee retaines the punishment of it; then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes necessarily on the contrary, that when hee doth forgiue sinne hee retaines not any punishment due to it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Temptation in a generall sense, signifieth a proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, or a taking triall of a thing or person: It is Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, as by pearcing thorow a thing is tryed what is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whether it be sound or no.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:493:51"/> of his weakenesse, making him see how vnable he is to stand without Gods continuall assisting grace. Thus God tried <hi>Abraham. Gen.</hi> 22.1.2. And the Israelites, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.3. And thus afflictions are called tentations. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.2.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, he doth, and that so grossely, that the very flesh is ashamed of it, as by temptations that are against the light of nature, euen nature corrupted; as for a man to kill his owne louing and beloued father or mother, where there is no hope of gaine, or matter of displeasure to prouoke to it; and by thoughts of Blasphemie against God the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, against the Word of God, and his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and such like: these are meerely from Satan himselfe, and not from the corruption of nature.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus; if temptations being against the light of Nature, doe come furiously, and like the flashings of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning suddenly, either without any dependance on former cogitations, or without any occasion of any outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect at all: so as we cannot imagine how they should come; and withall they haunt vs, and will not be put away; but the more wee striue against them, the more they come on vs, and withall are contriued subtilly and artificially; then are they from Satan meerely, and not from mans corruption.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus; the meaning of that place is, that God doth not stirre vp or moue any mans heart to sinne, or infuse euill and sinne into his heart.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> We are not to refuse this forme of prayer, nor the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the very words of the Lords prayer,<note place="margin">Luk. 11.2. compared with Hoze. 14.3.</note> for that were a proud contempt of Christ his Ordinance; yet wee are not to confine our selues only to the words of the Lords prayer, and to vse no other words: Christ neuer intended to binde vs to the forme of words, but of the matter; and it were extreame idlenesse &amp; superstition to vse the words of the Lords prayer alone, and none other.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two principall employments of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man, <hi>Practise,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> which two ought to goe ioyntly hand in hand the one with the other, through the whole tenour of each mans life. For by the one is obedience exhibited to Gods will: by the other is helpe and aide craued and procured at Gods hands. Both our <hi>Prayer</hi> therefore ought to be accompanied with <hi>Practise,</hi> and our <hi>Practise</hi> to be seconded with <hi>Prayer.</hi> For the neglect of the one is a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God; the neglect of the other is a presuming too much of our selues: Since that neither without our endeauour can any blessing of God be expected, nor any endeauour of ours without his blessing auaile ought. But such is mans misery since the fall of our first Parents, that naturally we faile much and come far short in the knowledge of either of these; neither of our selues well knowing what to doe, nor to aske; and therefore both doing that oft igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly that we ought not, and asking those things vnaduisedly, that are not fit to be asked. Now for the better reformation of our errours in either kind, it hath pleased God, of his gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to afford vs in his <hi>Word</hi> some speciall helpes and meanes of direction, as well for our practise as for our prayers. The maine direction that God hath giuen vs for our <hi>Practise,</hi> is comprised in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> or the <hi>Ten Commandements</hi> deliuered in <hi>Mount Sinay:</hi> the maine direction for our <hi>Prayers</hi> is contained in that forme of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which our Sauiour himselfe deliuered to his Disciples in the Gospell. But these both being but briefe Sums, consisting of generall Heads only, and the particular as well <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> as <hi>Necessities</hi> of mans Life being infinite; there needeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and vnfoulding of either for the due application thereof to such particular occurrents, as mens daily affaires &amp; occasions minister matter of in either kind. To which purpose as many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned men of God haue taken paines, and made publike their godly labours for the good of Gods Church; so this our reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and religious Brother, the Authour of this Worke, now at rest
<pb facs="tcp:493:73"/> with God, hath not come behind any of them in his endeauours ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Who, as he spent himselfe while he liued, in the Lords worke for the benefit of others, straining himselfe euen beyond that which the strength of his body would well beare, to instruct those whom God had committed vnto his charge: so hee hath left heere to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie such a worthy Monument of this nature, as may afford plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full light to those that are willing to make vse of it, for the direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well of their suites as their liues. In commendation whereof I shall need to say little, because the <hi>Worke</hi> sufficiently commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it selfe. Only this I will say of it, that by that short view that I haue had libertie and leasure to take of it, it appeareth vnto me both to be answerable to other the Authour his iudicious &amp; religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labours already extant; and for perspicuity of <hi>Method,</hi> plenty of <hi>Matter,</hi> and multiplicity of <hi>Questions</hi> and <hi>Cases of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> resolued in it, to goe beyond any that I haue hitherto seene in this argument. And albeit difference of Iudgements may be about some particulars therein discussed, (which in so great variety is not to be maruailed) yet I doubt not but that the diligent <hi>Reader,</hi> that maketh conscience of his courses, shall heere find sound &amp; suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground as well to settle his <hi>Iudgement</hi> as to regulate his <hi>practise</hi> in an innumerable number of such questions and cases as the occurrents and occasions of his life may produce. The worke (it seemeth) was prepared by the Authour himselfe for the Presse, and printed also some part of it before his discease, and had it beene the Lords will, I should heartily wish, that hee had surui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to haue seene the finishing and publishing of it himselfe. But the Lord hath prouided better for him, and putting an end to his Labours, hath translated him thither, where he enioyeth now the reward of them. In the way to which end if this worke of his shall further thee, (and it is thine owne fault if it doe not) giue the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God; and be thankefull to him, who hath afforded so plentiful light in these latter times vnto vs, ouer that which former ages haue had. To his gracious blessing (without which neither this nor ought else can auaile ought) commending thee, this worke, and thy perusall of it, I take leaue of thee, and rest</p>

                     <p>Quest. <hi>What is the first of those?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The first is taken from the name <hi>Iehouah,</hi> I am <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah,</hi> I am the Lord, and therefore I haue power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to command.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What signifieth the name</hi> Iehouah?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Three things.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What is the first of those?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> That the Lord hath his eternall beeing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1.8.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What is the second?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> That the Lord is he,<note place="margin">Iohn 44.24. Rom. 11.36 Heb. 1.3.</note> by whom all other things that are, haue their beeing and are sustained.</p>
                     <p>Quest: <hi>What is the third.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans:</hi> That all the Lords promises and threatnings shall come to passe, and that what he saith he will certainely make it good.<note place="margin">Exod. 6.3.</note>
                        <hi>I appeared vnto Abraham to Izack and to Iacob by the name of Almightie God, but by my name Jehouah was I not knowne vnto them,</hi> because he did not performe his promises to him but to his Children. <hi>Exod:</hi> 7.5.</p>
                     <p>Quest: <hi>What is the second reason vsed in this preface?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans:</hi> The second reason is from the couenant of grace, whereby the Lord assureth his people that he is their God, and that he will forgiue them their sinnes, and will giue them all good things needful for their soules and bodyes. (<hi>I am the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:493:75"/> Lord thy God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ierem. 32.38.</note>) which are the very words of the couenant of grace.</p>
                     <p>Quest: <hi>What is the third reason vsed in this preface?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans:</hi> The third is taken from gods mercy, in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull deliuerance of his people, the Isralites, out of Egipt, and house of cruell bondage, and seruitude: <hi>which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Quest: <hi>How doth that deliuerance from Egypt concerne vs?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans:</hi> That temporall benefit in times past bestowed on Israel, was a type or figure of the deliuerance of the Church of God, from all euills and enemies both bodily, and spirituall: and especially of the spirituall deliuerance of the church of God from the miserable thraldome of sinne, Satan, death,<note place="margin">Iere. 16 14.15. Luk. 1.71.72.</note> and Hell. The lesse deliuerance, was but a shadowe of the greater, and vnder the name of Israel all the faithfull are spoken to, as the Apostle witnesseth <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7.<note place="margin">Galat. 3.7.</note> So much of the preface.</p>

                        <hi>Ans:</hi> Two wayes. First, into ten commandements, or ten words. Secondly; into Two Tables. The first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning our duty to God,<note place="margin">Exod. 31.18. Deut. 9.10. Mat. 22.36.37.</note> in the foure first commandements. And the second, our dutie to our neighbour, in the other six commandements. Christ being asked which is the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; He answereth, thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.38.39.40.</note> with all thy soule, and with all thy mind. <hi>This is the first and the great commandement. And the second is like vnto this: thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe, On these two commandements, hangeth the whole Law and the prophets.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans:</hi> For two reasons.</p>
                     <p>First, because our dutie towards God is greater, and more exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>It is better to obey God then men:</hi> and therefore Christ calls the comande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the first table, the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans:</hi> Thus; the first and second commandement differ one from the other, in sence and matter; for one may offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the first commandement; as they that worship the Sunne, moone, and starres, and yet make no grauen image: &amp; some may offend against the second, and not against the first:<note place="margin">2.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Two wayes. First when a man doth place and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that which is not God, in the roome of the true God; as the heathen did, who worshipped the sunne, moone, starres,<note place="margin">Act. 19.27.15.</note> and such like.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> In these places of Scripture. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.32.33.41. <hi>Zephan.</hi> 1 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.10.11. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.21.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> By these reasons:</p>
                     <p>First, this is to giue religious worship to creatures, which belongs only to God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10, 20. expounded by our Sauiour Christ. <hi>Mat</hi> 4.10.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans:</hi> Thus, First by <hi>Angell</hi> is meant the Angell of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:493:77"/> Couenant. <hi>Malac.</hi> 3.1.<note place="margin">Malac. 3.1.</note> the Sonne of God the second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Trinity: so it is expounded <hi>Hosea.</hi> 12.4.5.<note place="margin">Hose. 12.4.5.</note>
                        <hi>Jacob</hi> (saith he) <hi>had power ouer the Angell and preuailed; he wept and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto him, hee found him in Bethell:</hi> The Angell hee found in <hi>Bethell</hi> was God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, where he saith, <hi>let the name of my Fathers Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and Izhak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>
                        </hi> it is a phrase of Scripture signifying thus much; let them be held and accounted, as belonging to the Stocke and Family of my Fathers, and numbred among their Sonnes: the like phrase is, <hi>Isai.</hi> 4.1.</p>

                     <p>Quest. <hi>How is this to be answered?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus; 1. By Saints, are not meant Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but on the Earth. 2. That phrase <hi>(Turne thee)</hi> doth not signifie invocation, but giue me oh <hi>Job,</hi> if thou canst any of the Saints; who if he were pressed with any calamitie, that did not suffer the same for his sinnes.

                     <p>First, in the beginning and cause,<note place="margin">Psal. 130.4. 1 Pet. 1.17.</note> for the child like feare of God, comes from the loue of God, whom Gods Children feare to offend, because of his goodnesse and mercy.</p>
                     <p>But Seruile feare ariseth from the consideration of the Iustice, and wrath of God.<note place="margin">1 Iohn. 4.11.</note>

                     <p>Secondly, in respect of the obiect;<note place="margin">Gen. 39.9. Rom. 13.5.</note> for child-like feare of God, is set on sinne it selfe, Gods Children fearing sinne principally, because it is sinne and offends God.</p>
                     <p>But seruile feare, is set on the punishment of sinne, men fearing onely the wrath and vengeance that followes on sinne.</p>
                     <p>Quest: <hi>How may we know that we truely feare God?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus; the Scriptures in ascribing humane parts to God, speake metaphorically, by way of similitude, and vse those borrowed speeches onely for our vnderstanding and capacitie.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:493:89"/> before, or vnder an Image, a Crucifixe, Bread in the Sacrament, or such like, are thereby made Idoles, and to those that so worship them, are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Idoles.</item>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> First, by euidence of Scripture, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.19, 20.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by this reason; Thereby they bind the presence, the grace, and operation of God and Christ to Images; and so make God such a God, and Christ such a Christ, as will bee present, and will heare them at Images; and so indeed they make them Idoles, and worshipping God and Christ in that manner, they worship Idoles of their owne braine.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, the Israelites did thus; they intended to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the true God in the Golden Calfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.5.<note place="margin">Iudg. 2.11, 12, 13.</note> yet that is called an Idole, <hi>Actes</hi> 7.49. so the Israelites worshipped <hi>Baal, Asteroth,</hi> Idoles fetched from the Gentiles: but their intent therein was,<note place="margin">Hosea 2.16.</note> to worship the true God in those I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doles.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> By two reasons: First, because this is to account Christ his body and the parts of it, as God himselfe; for what men sweare by, that they make able to witnesse the truth, and to punish them if they sweare falsly.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, because men in swearing by his body, and the parts of it, doe as much as in them is, crucifie Christ againe; and shew themselues worse then the <hi>Iewes</hi> that crucified him: for if they had knowne him,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.8.</note> they would not haue crucified the Lord of Glory.</p>

Now the cure of diseases by the words of Scripture is not naturall and ordinary; because the word of God is not giuen to cure bodily diseases: neither by miracle; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Gods power is not tied to certaine words, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so good. Therefore the cure of diseases so wrought is not of God, but of the Deuill.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, it doth; for though it be vnlawfull in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet in the substance it is an oath, and therefore ought to bee kept.</p>

                     <p>

                     <p>Quest. <hi>VVhat is the first of those?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This; when it is made of any thing directly against the word of God, and tends to the maintenance of sinne: for all the power an oath hath to bind, is from the word of God: and therefore being against the word of God, it hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to binde; &amp; an oath must not be a bond of iniquity. Hence it was,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.22.</note> that <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he had made a rash vow to destroy <hi>Nabal;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.32.23.34. 1 Sam. 19.23.</note> hee reioyced when <hi>Abigail</hi> by her comming, stayed him. And though hee sware to <hi>Shimei</hi> to saue his life, yet afterwards, vpon better consideration hee commanded his sonne <hi>Salomon</hi> that hee should not count him innocent.<note place="margin">1 King. 2.9. Mat. 14.9.</note>
                        <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> was deceiued, when he thought he was bound by his oath to performe his promise.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What is the second?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:493:110"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> When it is made against the good and wholesome Lawes of the Kingdome whereof a man is a member:<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1. 1 Pet. 2.13.</note> for Gods commandement, binds to keepe the good lawes of men.</p>
                     <p>Quest: <hi>What is the third?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans:</hi> This; when it is taken by such persons as want suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reason and discretion; as yong children, fooles, and mad-men. For conscience cannot be bound, where vnderstanding cannot discerne what is done, and where hee that sweareth wants reason and vnderstanding, to discerne what he doth.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What is the fourth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This; when it is taken by such persons, as are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tuition &amp; gouernment of others, and haue no power to bind themselues;<note place="margin">Numb. 30.4, 5,</note> as by Children that are vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of their Parents. For it is the Law of Nature, that hee which is not in his owne power, cannot bind himselfe without the consent of his gouernours.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What is the fift?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This; when it is made of a thing impossible, and out of a mans power; for that is a vaine oath, and a mocking of God; because a man cannot haue a serious purpose, when he sweareth to doe that which he knowes he cannot doe.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What is the sixt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This; when the oath is taken touching some thing, or things, that are lawfull to be done, and afterwards the same things become either impossible to bee done, or vnlawfull: for then God himselfe may be said to reuerse that oath, and God frō heauen frees a man from it, &amp; it ceaseth to bind. For example, a King sweares to a forraine Prince to aide him, and to defend him, and his people against his enemies: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that Prince becomes an enemie to him, and to his Religion, and people, &amp; then the Kings oath binds him not.</p>
                     <p>The Papists ad another case wherein an oath binds not.</p>
                     <p>Say they, the supreame power, that is, the Bishop of Rome, the Pope, may dispence with a lawfull oath, and free a man in conscience from the bond of a lawfull oath.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>Is this true or no?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is false. Because in a lawfull oath,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 20.8. 2 Sam. 21.7.</note> man is not only bound to man, but is thereby also immediately bound to God
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:493:111"/> himselfe; and therefore a lawfull oath is not dispensable by man, neither can any creature dispence with it, it is called <hi>The Lords oath.</hi>

                     <p>Quest. <hi>Is then the transgression of this Commandement so foule and so haynous a sinne?</hi>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:493:120"/> is an vsuall necessitie of doing the labours of them; it falls out that they are to be done almost euery Sabbath: what are men to doe in such cases?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a two fold present necessity; one which men contract and draw on themselues, and another which is laid on them by the immediate hand, &amp; prouidence of God; and men must consider what kinde of necessity it is, that lies on them; and accordingly carry themselues.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Men are not to labour in such necessitie as this is, on the Sabbath; because then the worke is not properly their owne worke, as they are of this or that trade or calling; but a worke of their lust, and of their owne corruption.</p>

                        <hi>Answ:</hi> This; when not through any neglect, ouersight, or other corruption of their owne; but by the immediate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, some businesse of their ordinarie calling is laid on them, which could not be done the day before, neither can be left vndone till the day after.</p>

                     <p>First, that their labour bee with as little hinderance of them, from the publike holy exercises, as possibly may bee.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, that they make not their work, a work of gaine, but of mercy, or tending to a worke of mercy.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that it serue to the immediate preseruation of the life, health, or good. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.8. <hi>Elijah</hi> continued flying from <hi>Iesabell</hi> to saue his life, many Sabbaths together. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.29.

                     <p>Quest. <hi>Why did the Lord annexe to this Commandement so many and so strong reasons to perswade to the obedience of it; and propounded some other Commandements without any reason at all?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Both because this Commandement is more spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and not so deepely imprinted in nature, as some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commandements are; as namely those that forbid mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, adulterie, and such like.</p>

Thus did <hi>Isaijah</hi> with the grosse Idolaters of his time, <hi>Isai:</hi> 44.16.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This; the not returning of the thing hired as it ought to bee returned.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>How is that done?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus; when the hyrer either returnes not the thing that he hath hyred at all: as hauing hyred an horse to ride on to a certaine place, he rideth quite away with him; or not at the time appoynted for the returne of it, but he wittingly &amp; purposely keepes it ouer and aboue that time, without the consent of the letter, or not in the state that hee receiued it, but either hurt or spoyled through his owne default, without making due satisfaction for that hurt or spoyle: as when one hauing hyred ground, makes waste on it, or weares out the heart of it:<note place="margin">Pro. 3.27. Act. 28.30.</note> or hauing hyred an house, doth deface it or spoile it, or let it runne to ruine carelessely, and makes it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenantable; or hauing hyred an horse or the like, doth ouer-labour the beast, or willingly so hurt it, as it is lamed or spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or such like.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This; the letting of a thing to hyre at an vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable rate; which is done either directly, or indirectly, and vnder a colour.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus; when it is let for more then can bee raysed and made of the vse of it in the iudgment of any that knowes and is able to iudge of it: as when the Land-lord racketh his rents, and raiseth them to such a rate, or taketh such excessiue Fines, as that the Tenant by all his care, labour and paines, and by his stocke on the land, house, shop, or such like, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make his owne, or liue by it: or when a man lets his cattell, their young ones, their milke, their labour in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and such like, for more then can be made of the vse of them in any mans iudgement who is able to iudge:<note place="margin">Isai. 3.14.15.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus; when it is let for an indifferent rate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the vse of the thing it selfe, yet so as the letter will not stand to the hazard of it, but makes the hyrer couenant with him absolutely, to make the thing hyred good to him at all times without any allowance, in respect of any casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that shall come, though the thing hyred being subiect to many casualties, doe perish without his default. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a man lets another three, foure, or more Kine, to finde them meate, and to haue the milke of them at such a rate, for a yeare, or more or lesse time; yet so, as hee bindes the hyrer that he shall from time to time make good to him the number

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This; the letting of a thing to hyre of worse qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie then is pretended: as when the letter lets that to the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer for his vse, which he knowes will not serue his turne: for example,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.29. 1 Thess. 4.6.</note> an Horse to ride on to a certaine place, which hee knowes will faile him before hee comes thither: this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, one of the sinnes of the Heathen, who were giuen vp to a reprobate sense, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. and this is <hi>circumuenting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding of a brother.</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.6.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This; the withholding from the hyrer the vse of the thing let to him to hyre, either in whole or in part: as when one hauing let house, shop, land, and such like, he takes away and withholds from the hyrer the vse of it in whole or in part,<note place="margin">Isai. 16.14. Ephes. 6.6. Coloss. 3.22.

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> No, it is not, lying being in it owne nature simply euill, it may not bee vsed for the sauing either of our owne life, or the life of any other.</p>

Now it may so fall out, that a lye may bee a lesse euill, then that which may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on the telling of it: for example, It may bee that a man by telling of a lye may keepe close an innocent person, that lyes hid from another who seekes his life, and intends to kill him; and by saying hee knowes not where he is, though he doe know, hee may hinder the one from murdering, and the other from being murdered.

And in the case propounded, a man may auoyd both lying, and also the discouering of him that lies hid: for hee may either be silent, or say, he knowes where he is, but he will not discouer him: &amp; this he is rather to doe, then to lye, or to discouer him, though he do therby expose himselfe to danger, through the rage of him that pursues the innocent partie.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus; the argument is not good, because the acts of Adulterie &amp; Theft are forbidden in two diuers precepts, therefore concupiscences tending thereunto should be so: for there is difference betweene the conceptiō of sin, &amp; the birth and perfection of it: when sin is brought forth and perfected, then it appeareth of what kinde it is; but being yet in the seed and conception, it cannot be so distinguished.</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> No: it is not possible, because the law of God is spirituall, and forbids not only the externall euill act, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the internall euill thought and motion to euill in the soule of man, though no consent of will be giuen to it; and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires absolute and perfect obedience to it, as well in the soule as in the body: and we are full of weakenesse and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and carnall in part, though we be regenerate.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What vse then is there of the Morall Law of God, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is impossible to keepe it perfectly in this life?</hi>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It serues to teach vs the constant and vnchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nature of it selfe,<note place="margin">Leuit. 18.5. Ezech. 20.11. Rom. 3.20. 2 Cor. 3.7.9.
